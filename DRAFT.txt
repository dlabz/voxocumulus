
////single object///
voxelArray.uid is a UID of that block.

data is packed in a 3D array. voxelArray[x][y][z] will get a 4 letter string representing ARGB(0xffffffff) values of a pixel/voxel at x,y,z coordinates
////////optional: properties .a .r .g .b get single channel


for nesting cubes every value should have a and .refersTo property where uid of a voxel block will be stored. Based on a onScreen size of a block, if it's bigger than something render will check if refersTo != 0 and accordingly exchange it with a block it referes to

//end single object




/////modeling function///o3d

modeling function will be used to creat a 3d object from a voxelArray. It will keep track of references and use them to create maps(bump or vertex) and skin each voxel bigg enugh with it's reference. 

This function should either run on a separate tread or be fake-treaded to allow instant display of loaded/processed data

///endmodelfunction





//render function//o3d

render should take a created world and display it on screen. 
it needs to support shading or real shadows
vertexshaders, bumpmaps wich should both be used, depending on onscreen size of a block / distance from camera

some heavy cooling




//endrenderfunction


///
optional
Use a function to convert 3d array to 1D array for encoding  and decoding a bitmap

////

for operations on bitmap create getPixel32(x,y) and setPixel32(x,y,c)
